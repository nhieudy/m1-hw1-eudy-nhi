## About Me
My name is Nhi Eudy, and I am an electrical engineer at the FAA. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in Fall of 2021 with an Electrical Engineering Degree. I have two dogs, recently got into bouldering, and enjoy art!
## Past Coding Experience
I know a bit of JavaScript, Python, and C++ from school, but I still feel like a beginner so I look forward to learning more!
## Career Goals
I want to move on from engineering, and pursue a career in Web Design or Graphic Design. I miss being able to be more creative, and I think Web Design has a good balance of technical skills and design/artistic skills.
